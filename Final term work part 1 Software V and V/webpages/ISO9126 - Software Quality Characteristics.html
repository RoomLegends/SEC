<center><h2>Article Purpose</h2></center>
The purpose of this article is to present an overview of the ISO 9126 
standard and to give a detailed description of the software quality 
model
 used by this standard.
<br>
<br>
ISO 9126 is an international standard for the evaluation of software. 
The standard is divided into four parts which addresses, respectively, 
the following subjects: quality model; external metrics; internal 
metrics; and quality in use metrics.
ISO 9126 Part one, referred to as ISO 9126-1 is an extension of previous
 work done by <a href="http://www.sqa.net/softwarequalityattributes.html">McCall (1977), Boehm (1978)</a>, <a href="http://www.sqa.net/index.htm#furps">FURPS</a> and others in defining a set of software quality characteristics.
<br>
<br>
ISO9126-1 represents the latest (and ongoing) research into 
characterizing software for the purposes of software quality control, 
software quality assurance and software process improvement (SPI).
This article defines the characteristics identified by ISO 9126-1. The 
other parts of ISO 9126, concerning metrics or measurements for these 
characteristics, are essential for SQC, SQA and SPI but the main
concern of this article is the definition of the basic ISO 9126 Quality 
Model.
<br>
<br>
The ISO 9126 documentation itself, from the <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/en/ISOOnline.frontpage">official ISO 9126 documentation</a>,
 can only be purchased and is subject to copyright.
SQA.net only reproduces the basic structure of the ISO 9126 standard and
 any descriptions, commentary or guidance are original material based on
 
public domain information as well as our own experience.
<br>
<br>
The ISO 9126-1 software quality model identifies <b>6 main quality characteristics</b>, namely:
<ul>
<li>Functionality</li>
<li>Reliability</li>
<li>Usability</li>
<li>Efficiency</li>
<li>Maintainability</li> 
<li>Portability</li>
</ul>
These characteristics are broken down into subcharacteristics, a high 
level table is shown below. It is at the subcharacteristic level that 
measurement for SPI will occur.
The main characteristics of the ISO9126-1 quality model, can be defined 
as follows:-
<br>
<br>
<b>Functionality</b>
<br>
Functionality is the essential purpose of any product or service. For 
certain items this is relatively easy to define, for example <i>a ship's anchor</i>
 has the function
of holding a ship at a given location. The more functions a product has,
 e.g. an ATM machine, then the more complicated it becomes to define 
it's functionality. For software a list 
of functions can be specified, i.e. a sales order processing systems 
should be able to <i>record customer information</i> so that it can be used to 
reference a sales order. A sales order system should also provide the following functions: 
<ul>
<li>Record sales order product, price and quantity.</li>
<li>Calculate total price.</li>
<li>Calculate appropriate sales tax.</li>
<li>Calculate date available to ship, based on inventory.</li>
<li>Generate purchase orders when stock falls below a given threshold.</li>
</ul>
The list goes on and on but the main point to note is that functionality
 is expressed as a totality of essential functions that the software 
product provides. It is also important to note that the presence or 
absence of these functions in a software product 
can be verified as either existing or not, in that it is a Boolean 
(either a yes or no answer). The other software characteristics listed 
(i.e. usability) are only present to some degree, i.e. not a simple on 
or off.
Many people get confused between  overall process functionality (in 
which software plays a part) and software functionality. This is partly 
due to the fact that Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) and other modeling tools 
can depict 
process functionality (as a set of data in\data out conversions) and 
software functionality. Consider a sales order process, that has both 
manual and software components. A function of 
the sales order process could be to record the sales order but we could 
implement a <i>hard copy</i> filing cabinet for the actual orders and 
only use software for calculating the price, tax and ship date. In this 
way the
functionality of the software is limited to those calculation functions.
 SPI, or Software Process Improvement is different from overall Process 
Improvement or Process Re-engineering, ISO 9126-1 and other software 
quality models do not
help measure overall Process costs\benefits but only the software 
component.
The relationship between software functionality within an overall 
business process is outside the scope of ISO 9126 and it is only the
software functionality, or essential purpose of the software component, 
that is of interest for ISO 9126.
<br>
<br>
<b>Following functionality, there are 5 other software attributes that 
characterize the usefulness of the software in a given environment.</b>
<br>
Each of the following characteristics can only be measured (and are 
assumed to exist) when the functionality of a given system is present. 
In this way, for example, a system can not possess <i>usability</i>
characteristics if the system does not function correctly (the two just don't go together).

<br>
<br>                        
<b>Reliability</b>
<br>
Once a software system is functioning, as specified, and delivered the 
reliability characteristic defines the capability of the system to
maintain its service provision under defined conditions for defined 
periods of time. One aspect of this characteristic is <i>fault tolerance</i>
 that is
the ability of a system to withstand component failure. For example if 
the network goes down for 20 seconds then comes back the system should 
be able to recover and 
continue functioning.
<br>
<br>
<b>Usability</b>
<br>
Usability only exists with regard to functionality and refers to the 
ease of use for a given function. For example a function of an ATM 
machine is to dispense cash as requested.
Placing common amounts on the screen for selection, i.e. $20.00, $40.00,
 $100.00 etc, does not impact the function of the ATM but addresses the 
Usability of the function.
The ability to learn how to use a system (learnability) is also a major 
subcharacteristic of usability.
<br>
<br>
<b>Efficiency</b>
<br>
This characteristic is concerned with the system resources used when 
providing the required functionality. The amount of disk space, memory, 
network etc. provides a good indication of this 
characteristic. As with a number of these characteristics, there are 
overlaps. For example the usability of a system is influenced by the 
system's Performance, in that if a system 
takes 3 hours to respond the system would not be easy to use although 
the essential issue is a performance or efficiency characteristic.
<br>
<br>
<b>Maintainability</b>
<br>
The ability to identify and fix a fault within a software component is 
what the maintainability characteristic addresses. In other software 
quality models this characteristic is referenced as supportability. 
Maintainability is impacted by code readability or complexity as well as
 modularization. Anything that helps with identifying the cause of a 
fault and then fixing the fault is the concern of
maintainability. Also the ability to verify (or test) a system, i.e. 
testability, is one of the subcharacteristics of maintainability.
<br>
<br>
<b>Portability</b>
<br>
This characteristic refers to how well the software can adopt to changes
 in its environment or with its requirements. The subcharacteristics of 
this characteristic include adaptability.
Object oriented design and implementation practices can contribute to 
the extent to which this characteristic is present in a given system.

<center><h2>ISO 9126 Observations</h2></center>
<br>
For the most part, the overall structure of ISO9126-1 is similar to past
 models, McCall (1977) and Boehm (1978), although there are a couple of 
notable differences.
Compliance comes under the functionality characteristic, this can be 
attributed to government initiatives like SOX. In many requirements 
specifications 
all characteristics, that are specified, that are not pure functional 
requirements are specified as <i>Non-Functional</i> requirements. 
It is interesting to note, with ISO9126, that compliance is seen as a functional characteristic.

</center>
<br>
<br>                        
Using the ISO 9126 (or any other quality model) for derivation of system
 requirements brings clarity of definition of purpose and operating 
capability .
<br>
For example a <i>rules engine</i> approach to compliance would enable 
greater adaptability, should the compliance rules change.
The functionality for compliance could be implemented in other ways but 
these other implementation methods may not produce as strong an 
adaptability characteristic as a rules, or some other component based, 
architecture.
<br>
<br>
Also, a designer typically will need to make trade offs between two or 
more characteristics when designing the system. Consider highly 
modularized code, this code is
usually easy to maintain, i.e. has a good <i>changeability</i> 
characteristic, but may not perform as well (for cpu resource, as 
unstructed program code). On a similar vein a normalized database may 
not perform as well as
a not normalized database. These trade offs need to be identified, so 
that informed design decisions can be made.
<br>
<br>
Although ISO 9126-1 is the latest proposal for a useful Quality Model, 
of software characteristics, it is unlikely to be the last.
One thing is certain, the requirements (including compliance) and 
operating environment of software will be continually changing and with 
this change will come 
the continuing search to find useful characteristics that facilitate 
measurement and control of the software production process.
